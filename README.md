# 💻 **TakeABreak Desktop**
> A modern, cross-platform break reminder app to help you **pause and relax**.

---

### 🎯 Inspired by [SafeEyes](https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes)  
**TakeABreak Desktop** is an Electron-based alternative to SafeEyes, designed to provide **customizable and enforced breaks** that help reduce **eye strain, posture fatigue, and screen burnout**.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
✅ **Customizable Breaks** – Set your own break intervals and durations  
✅ **Short & Long Breaks** – Different activities and timers for each  
✅ **Strict Mode** – Prevent skipping breaks for better health discipline  
✅ **Audio Alerts** – Plays relaxing sounds before and after each break  
✅ **System Tray Access** – Manage settings and trigger breaks manually  
✅ **Cross-Platform** – Works on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**  
✅ **Minimal & Lightweight** – Runs quietly in the background

---

## 🎥 **Video Preview**
Here’s a short demo showing **manual break triggering** — the app also supports **automatic breaks** in real usage:
